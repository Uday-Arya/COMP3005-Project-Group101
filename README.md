This project implements a database-driven Health and Fitness Club Management System that supports 3 user roles:

1) Members: Register, update profiles, track health metrics, book classes & personal training.

2) Trainers: Manage availability, view schedules, and look up assigned members.

3) Administrative Staff: Manage rooms, classes, equipment, and billing.

The system uses a relational PostgreSQL database designed from a complete ER model and converted into a normalized relational schema (3NF). All interactions occur through ORM set up in Java, using Hibernate and Springboot.
